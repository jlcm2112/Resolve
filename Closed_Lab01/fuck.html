<H1>Words from file1.txt</H1>
Each line (supposedly one word :-) is a separate Text item in the object of type Set_Of_Text. Notice that there is nothing in the specification that guarantees the wishful naming that a "word" really consists of a single word! If this line appears in the output for file2.txt, then you forgot to clear the produces-mode parameter. <H1>Words from file2.txt</H1>
one word, namely the word In this file, -- i.e., "file," including the comma -- appears multiple times. Still, each "word" (really, line) should appear in the output only once! <H1>Words from file2.txt (again)</H1>
