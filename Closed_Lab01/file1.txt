Each
line
(supposedly one word :-)
is
a
separate
Text
item
in
the
object
of
type
Set_Of_Text.
Notice that there is nothing in the specification that guarantees the wishful naming that a "word" really consists of a single word!
If this line appears in the output for file2.txt, then you forgot to clear the produces-mode parameter.
